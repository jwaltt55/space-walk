# space-walk
a small music visualizer made with babylonjs!

to run this project, you'll first need to host it on a server. i personally used [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) while working on it.

before running it, you'll also probably want to add at least one song for it to play. just save an audio file into the music folder, and set the "src" attribute of the <audio> element in the html file to be "music/your_song_name_here". make sure it's the full filename, including the extension!
